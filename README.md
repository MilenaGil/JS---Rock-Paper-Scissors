# JavaScript Rock-Paper-Scissors

A Rock Paper Scissors game project built using JavaScript. More updates soon, work in progress...

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that demonstrates how to create a Rock Paper Scissors game from scratch. Itâ€™s a great way to learn about DOM manipulation, localStorage and JavaScript logic.

The project is contained in a file with the .html extension.
